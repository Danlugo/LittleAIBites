# Google's Gemini - A Leap Forward in AI, A Step Back in Sensitivity
In recent news, Google's ambitious AI project, Gemini, has been the talk of the tech world, drawing attention for both significant advancements and controversy. 

## A Misstep in AI Image Generation
Gemini's image generator, known for its ability to produce stunningly realistic images, faced a wave of backlash over its inaccurate and insensitive historical depictions of race. Social media was buzzing with criticism over the AI's inappropriate insertion of diversity in its images, leading to historically inaccurate representations. This prompted Google to put a pause on the AI's image-synthesis feature and issue an apology for the inaccuracies.

## Google Gemini's Text-Generating Capabilities
Despite the controversy over its image generator, Google continues to drive forward with Gemini's text-generating capabilities. Google has integrated its latest language model into a host of Android features. You can now directly interact with Gemini in Google Messages to draft emails, learn more information, or even just have an engaging conversation with the AI. These capabilities have also been extended to Gmail, Docs, and other Workspace apps for personal accounts.

## The Impact on Alphabet's Share Price
The wave of controversy surrounding Gemini sent ripples through the market, leading to a 4% decrease in Alphabet's share price. This impact was felt strongly by Google's parent company, Alphabet, with a loss of nearly ninety billion dollars in market value.

## AI's Limitations in Understanding Complex Issues
The incident has brought to light the limitations of AI in understanding and representing complex and sensitive issues. Gemini's leap forward in AI technology also highlighted the challenges in managing the system's complexity and reasoning power, particularly in areas such as historical image generation.
